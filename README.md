# InterfaceDevelopmentProject
My project for BTS Interface Development course.
<br/>

### Wished result and achievement
<br/>
The objective I had for this project, was to make the first screen of my portfolio, add a title, a menu,
a grid with pictures and link each of them to a different page to make it interactive. At the beginning, 
I didn’t think I was going to achieve this as I wanted, but by the end, when I achieved each of these
goals I set myself a different goal to reach and little by little I ended up doing all the menu pages and
adding the picture inside the main project pictures.
<br/>
I started by picking up a portfolio template on codepen.io which had
a nice title and grid of pictures. Very clean and nice:

<br/>
And after that, a template with horizontal menues with nice
interactions:

<br/>
My first idea was to start a new project copying one by one the
elements I needed. So I started by “cleaning” the template of the
title, then the menu and then putting them together in a template.

But it was here when I had the first problem, one was on sass and
the other one on css and even that it worked at some point because
I somehow “translated” the sass code into css, I was having problems
with the grid of the pictures and I also knew this was going to give
me some hard moments afterwards.
<br/>
So I decided to look for another grid that was on css, and I found
this one with a 3 column grid and with a nice animation on each
of the pictures:

So I removed the elements I didn’t want, like the shadow of the
pictures and the title and added it to my code. After that, I
started trying to link some of my pictures but I had to upload
them somewhere and then link them from there. (This one
picture worked because it was from a link on facebook so it was
already uploaded). But after this, I decided to change to another
program, Brackets, which is similar to visual studio code.
<br/> 
And then everything started to work, explained step by step in the pdf document and how you can see in the final project.
